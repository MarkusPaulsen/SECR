Due to the size of the trained model, we decided to not put the classification models on GitHub. Instead, you can find the folders

- relevance_model here (goto "/roberta", copy the folder "best_model" and rename it "relevance_model"): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DUAa0wnqgrajcLlkkfFLQCKsp8mWefcE
- term_label_model here (goto "/roberta", copy the folder "best_model" and rename it "term_label_model"): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bP5MulhdnkiOTIcCsEgmLIIt0qDblEaF
